High priority:
1)models/customers
    - finished scripts "create_corp_user", "create_corp_folder", "create_site_folder_and_subfolders"
    - check that I'm able to create users each time I create customer. Also need to write option to change
        password. Username field must be deleted, because it's anyway is equal to the name of the site in lowercase
2)ftp server
    - I need to finish setup vsftpd, it's impossible to work with it from outside the network

Medium priority:
    - make tests scenarios for backups

Low priority:
    - read about 'signals' in Django docs https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/signals/
        signal is not OK if the process take more then 2 sec
    - read about 'cerely' https://habrahabr.ru/post/269347/
